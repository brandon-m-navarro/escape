Coordinate

	SquareCoordinate
	================
	(3, 4) -> (3, 6) | 2	- Simple horizontal check
	(3, 6) -> (3, 4) | 2
	
	(5, 5) -> (8, 5) | 3	- Simple vertical check
	(8, 5) -> (5, 5) | 3
	
	(4, 2) -> (8, 6) | 4	- Simple diagonal check (UP: L -> R)
	(8, 6) -> (4, 2) | 4
	
	(3, 7) -> (2, 6) | 1	- Simple diagonal check (DOWN: R -> L)
	(2, 6) -> (3, 7) | 1
	
	(4, 4) -> (8, 5) | 4	- Diagonals are allowed, so (UP: L -> R) once
							  then UP 3 more times	  
	(8, 5) -> (4, 4) | 4
	
	(4, 6) -> (6, 2) | 4   	- Slightly more complex case where we need to
							  traverse diagonally twice
	(6, 2) -> (4, 6) | 4
